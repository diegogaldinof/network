README

To better enjoy Thursday's meeting:

1. download the zip file and extract it somewhere on your computer.

2. make sure that you have installed R and RStudio and that they are up to date.

3. open the folder you extracted and open the Rproj file (a light blue cube with an R in the center). This will open a project in your RStudio. This project will tell R where it will search or save files.
